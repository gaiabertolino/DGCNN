# Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Link Prediction in Twitter Data 

#### Keywords : Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN), Link Prediction, Twitter Data, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Social Network Analysis.

This project explores link prediction in Twitter user data using a **Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN)**. The key innovation lies in leveraging a **dynamic adjacency matrix for link prediction**, combined with a **low-dimensional representation** to efficiently manage the high number of parameters. This approach enhances the modelâ€™s ability to capture the evolving relationships between users.

The architecture is inspired by the model introduced in the paper:
T. Song, W. Zheng, P. Song, and Z. Cui, *"EEG Emotion Recognition Using Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"* in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 532-541, 1 July-Sept. 2020, doi: 10.1109/TAFFC.2018.2817622.

This project was developed as the final requirement for the *Social Network Analysis exam* during my master's degree in Computer Engineering (specialization in AI and Machine Learning).
